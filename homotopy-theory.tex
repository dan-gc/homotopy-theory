\begin{defn}\leavevmode
	\begin{itemize}
		\item An \textbf{\textit{initial object}} in a category $\Cc$ is an object $\varnothing$ such that for any object $x\in\Cc$ there is a unique morphism $\varnothing\to x$ with source $\varnothing$ and target $x$.
		
		\item \label{defn:arrow-cat}
		 For $\Cc$ any category, its \textbf{\textit{arrow category}} $\Arr(\Cc)$ is the category such that
		\begin{itemize}
			\item an object $a$ of $\Arr(C)$ is a morphism $a:a_0\to a_1$ of $\Cc$,
			\item a morphism $f:a\to b$ of $\Arr(\Cc)$ is a commutative square
			\[\begin{tikzcd}
				a_0\arrow[r,"f_0"]\arrow[d,swap,"a"]&b_0\arrow[d,"b"]\\
				a_1\arrow[r,swap,"f_1"]&b_1
			\end{tikzcd}\]
			in $\Cc$,
			\item composition in $\Arr(\Cc)$ is given simply by placing commutative squares side by side to get a commutative oblong.
		\end{itemize}
		This is isomorphic to the functor category
		\[\Arr(\Cc):=\Funct(I,C)=[I,C]=C^I\]
		for $I$ the intervale category $\{0\to 1\}$.
		
		\item An \textbf{\textit{equalizer}} is a limit 
		\[\begin{tikzcd}
			\eq\arrow[r,"e"]&X\arrow[r,shift={(0,0.07)},"f"]\arrow[r,shift={(0,-0.07)},"g",swap]&Y
		\end{tikzcd}\]
		over a parallel pair of morphisms $f$ and $g$. This means that for $f:X\to Y$ and $g:X\to Y$ in a category $\Cc$, their equalizer, if it exists, is
		\begin{itemize}
			\item an object $\eq(f,g)\in\Cc$,
			\item a morphism $\eq(f,g)\to X$
			\item such that
			\begin{itemize}
				\item pulled back to $\eq(f,g)$ both morphisms become equal:
				\[\begin{tikzcd}
					\eq(f,g)\arrow[r]&X\arrow[r,"f"]&Y
				\end{tikzcd}\quad=\quad
				[\begin{tikzcd}
					\eq(f,g)\arrow[r]&X\arrow[r,"g"]&Y
				\end{tikzcd}\]
				\item and $\eq(f,g)$ is the universal object with this property.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
		The dual concept is that of coequalizer.
		
		\item The concept of coequalizer in a general category is the generalization of the construction where out of two functions $f$ and $g$ between sets $X$ and $Y$ one forms the set $Y/\sim$ of equivalence classes induced by the equivalence relation $f(x)\sim g(y)$. This means the the quotient function $p:Y\to Y/\sim$ satisfies
		\[p\circ f=p\circ g.\]
		In some category $\Cc$, the \textbf{\textit{coequalizer $\coeq(f,g)$}} of two parallel morphisms $f$ and $g$ between two objects $X$ and $Y$, if it exists, is the colimit under the diagram formed by these two morphisms
		\[\begin{tikzcd}
		X\arrow[rr,shift={(0,0.07)},"f"]\arrow[rr,shift={(0,-0.07)},"g",swap]\arrow[dr]&&Y\arrow[ld]\\
		&\coeq(f,g)
		\end{tikzcd}\]
		Equivalently, in a category $\Cc$ a diagram
		\[\begin{tikzcd}
			X\arrow[r,shift={(0,0.07)},"f"]\arrow[r,shift={(0,-0.07)},"g",swap]&Y\arrow[r,"p"]&Z
		\end{tikzcd}\]
		is called a \textbf{\textit{coequalizer}} diagram if
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item $p\circ f=p\circ g$,
			\item $p$ is universal for this property: if $q:Y\to W$ is a morphism of $\Cc$ such that $q\circ f=q\circ g$, then there is a unique morphism $\phi:Z\to W$ such that $\phi\circ p=q$
				\[\begin{tikzcd}
				X\arrow[r,shift={(0,0.07)},"f"]\arrow[r,shift={(0,-0.07)},"g",swap]&Y\arrow[d,"q"]\arrow[r,"p"]&Z\arrow[dl,"\phi",dashed]\\
				&W
			\end{tikzcd}\]
		\end{enumerate}
		The coequalizer in $\Cc$ is equivalently an equializer in the opposite category $\Cc^{\op}$.
		
		\item A \textbf{\textit{pullback}} of the morphisms $f$ and $g$ consists of an object $P$ and two morphisms $p_1:P\to X$ and $p_2:P\to Y$ satisfying the following universal property:
		\[\begin{tikzcd}
			Q\arrow[rrd,bend left,"q_2"]\arrow[ddr,"q_1",swap,bend right]\arrow[dr,dashed,"\phi"]\\
			&P\arrow[r,"p_2"] \arrow[rd, phantom, "\lrcorner", very near start]\arrow[d,"p_1",swap]&Y\arrow[d,"g"]\\
			&X\arrow[r,"f",swap]&Z
		\end{tikzcd}\]
		\item A \textbf{\textit{pushout}} of the morphisms $f$ and $g$ consists of an object $P$ and two morphisms $i_1:P\to X$ and $i_2:P\to Y$ satisfying the following universal property:
		\[\begin{tikzcd}
			Z\arrow[r,"g"]\arrow[d,swap,"f"]&Y\arrow[d,"i_2"]\arrow[ddr,bend left,"j_2"]\\
			X\arrow[r,"i_1",swap]\arrow[drr,bend right,swap,"j_1"]&P\arrow[ul, phantom, "\ulcorner", very near start]\arrow[dr,dashed,"\phi"]\\
			&&Q
		\end{tikzcd}\]
		\begin{remark}
			Other names for the pushout are \textbf{\textit{cofibered product of $X$ and $Y$}} (especially in algebraic categories when $i_1$ and $i_2$ are monomorphisms), or \textbf{\textit{free product of $X$ and $Y$}} with $Z$ \textbf{\textit{amalgamated sum}}, or more simply an \textbf{\textit{amalgamation}} or \textbf{\textit{amalgarm of $X$ and $Y$.}}
		\end{remark}
		\begin{remark}
			If coproducts exist in some category, then the pushout 
			\[\begin{tikzcd}
				Z\arrow[r,"g"]\arrow[d,swap,"f"]&Y\arrow[d,"i_2"]\\
				X\arrow[r,"i_1",swap]&X\coprod_Z Y\arrow[ul, phantom, "\ulcorner", very near start]
			\end{tikzcd}\]
			is equivalently the coequalizer 
			\[\begin{tikzcd}
				X\arrow[r,shift={(0,0.07)},"i_1\circ f"]\arrow[r,shift={(0,-0.07)},"i_2\circ g",swap]&X\coprod Y\arrow[r]&X\coprod_Z Y
			\end{tikzcd}\]
			of the two morphisms induced by $f$ and $g$ into the coproduct of $X$ with $Y$.
		\end{remark}
		\begin{example}[\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushout_(category_theory)}{wiki}]\leavevmode
			\begin{itemize}
				\item If $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ are sets and $f,g$ are functions, the pushout of $f$ and $g$ is the disjoint union of $X$ and $Y$ where elements sharing a common preimage in $Z$ are identified, i.e. $P=\left(X\coprod Y\right)/\sim$ where $\sim$ is the finest equivalence relation such that $f(z)\sim g(z)$ for all $z\in Z$.
			
			In particular, if $X$ and $Y$ are subsets of some larger set $W$ and $Z$ is their intersection, with $f$ and $g$ the inclusion maps of $Z$ into $X$ and $Y$, then the pusout can be canonically identified with the union $X\cup Y\subseteq W$.
			\item \label{adjunction-space}The construcion of \textbf{\textit{adjunction spaces}} is an example of pushouts in $\Top$. More precisely, if $Z$ is a subspace of $Y$ and $g:Z\to Y$ is the inclusion map, we can glue $Y$ to another space $X$ along $Z$ using an \textbf{\textit{attaching map}} $f:Z\to X$. The result is the \textbf{\textit{adjunction space}} $X\cup_f Y$ which is just the pushout of $f$ and $g$. More generally, all identification spaces may be regarded as pushouts in this way. See \cref{defn:CW-complex}.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{example}
		\item A \textbf{\textit{product}} of $X$ and $Y$ is an object $X\sqcup Y$ and a pair of morphisms $p_1:X\sqcap Y\to X$, $p_2:X\sqcap Y\to Y$ satisfying the following universal property:
		\[\begin{tikzcd}
			Q\arrow[rrd,bend left,"q_2"]\arrow[ddr,"q_1",swap,bend right]\arrow[dr,dashed,"\phi"]\\
			&X\sqcap Y\arrow[r,"p_2"]\arrow[d,"p_1",swap]&Y\\
			&X
		\end{tikzcd}\]
		\item A \textbf{\textit{coproduct}} of $X$ and $Y$ is an object $X\sqcup Y$ and a pair of morphisms $i_1:X\to X\sqcup Y$, $i_2:Y\to X\sqcup Y$ satisfying the following universal property:
		\[\begin{tikzcd}
			&Y\arrow[d,"i_2"]\arrow[ddr,bend left,"j_2"]\\
			X\arrow[r,"i_1",swap]\arrow[drr,bend right,swap,"j_1"]&X\sqcup Y\arrow[dr,dashed,"\phi"]\\
			&&Q
		\end{tikzcd}\]
		\begin{remark}
			More generally, for $S$ any set and $F:S\to\Cc$ a collection of objects in $\Cc$ indexed by $S$, their \textbf{\textit{coproduct}} is an object
			\[\coprod_{s\in S}F(s)\]
			equipped with maps
			\[F(s)\to\coprod_{s\in S}F(s)\]
			such that this is universal among objects with maps from $F(s)$.
		\end{remark}
		\item The \textbf{\textit{kernel}} of a morphism is that part of its domain which is sent to zero. Formally, in a category with an initial object 0 and pullbacks, the \textbf{\textit{kernel $\ker f$}} of a morphism $f:A\to B$ is the pullback $\ker(f)\to A$ along $f$ of the unique morphism $0\to B$
		
		More explicitly, this characterizes the object $\ker(f)$ as \textit{the} object (unique up to isomorphism) that satisfies the following universal property:
		\begin{quote}
			for every object $C$ and every morphism $h:C\to A$ such that $f\circ h=0$ is the zero morphism, there is a unique morphism $\phi:C\to\ker(f)$ such that $h=p\circ\phi$.
		\end{quote}
		\[\begin{tikzcd}
			C\arrow[dr,dashed,"\phi"]\arrow[ddr,bend right,swap,"h"]\\
			&\ker(f)\arrow[d]\arrow[r]&0\arrow[d]\\
			&A\arrow[r,"f",swap]&B\arrow[ul, phantom, "\ulcorner", very near start]
		\end{tikzcd}\]
		\item In a category with a terminal object 1, the \textbf{\textit{cokernel}} of a morphism $f:A\to B$ is the pushout (arrows $h$ and $\phi$ apply if terminal object is zero)
		\[\coker(f):=1\sqcup_AB\qquad\qquad\begin{tikzcd}
			A\arrow[r,"f"]\arrow[d]\arrow[dr, phantom, "\lrcorner", very near start]&B\arrow[d]\arrow[rdd,bend left,"h"]\\
			1\arrow[r]&\coker(f)\arrow[dr,dashed,"\phi"]\\
			&&C
		\end{tikzcd}\]
		In the case when the terminal object is in fact zero object, one can, more explicitly, characterize the object $\coker(f)$ with the following universal property:
		\begin{quote}
			for every object $C$ and every morphism $h:B\to C$ such that $h\circ f=0$ is the zero morphism, there is a unique morphism $\phi:\coker(f)\to C$ such that $h=\phi\circ i$.
		\end{quote}
		
		\item A morphism $f:X\to Y$ is a \textbf{\textit{monomorphism}} if for every object $Z$ and every pair of morphisms $g_1,g_2:Z\to X$ then
		\[f\circ g_1=f\circ g_2\implies g_1=g_2.\]
		\[\begin{tikzcd}
			Z\arrow[r,shift={(0,.06)},"g_1"]\arrow[r,swap,shift={(0,-.06)},"g_2"]\arrow[rr,bend left,"f\circ g_1"]\arrow[rr,bend right,swap,"f\circ g_2"]&X\arrow[r,"f"]&Y
		\end{tikzcd}\]
		Equivalently, $f$ is a monomorphism if for every $Z$ the hom-functor $\Hom(Z,-)$ takes it to an injective function
		\[\begin{tikzcd}
			\Hom(Z,X)\arrow[r,hook,"f_*"]&\Hom(Z,Y).
		\end{tikzcd}\]
		Being a monomorphism in a category $\Cc$ means equivalently that it is an epimorphism in the opposite category $\Cc^{\op}$.
		
		\item A morphism $f:X\to Y$ is a \textbf{\textit{epimorphism}} if for every object $Z$ and every pair of morphisms $g_1,g_2:Y\to Z$ then
		\[g_1\circ f=g_2\circ f\implies g_1=g_2.\]
		\[\begin{tikzcd}
			X\arrow[r,"f"]\arrow[rr,bend right,swap,"g_2\circ f"]\arrow[rr,bend left,"g_1\circ f"]&Y\arrow[r,shift={(0,.06)},"g_1"]\arrow[r,swap,shift={(0,-.06)},"g_2"]&Z
		\end{tikzcd}\]
		Equivalently, $f$ is a epimorphism if for every $Z$ the hom-functor $\Hom(-,Z)$ takes it to an injective function
		\[\begin{tikzcd}
			\Hom(Y,Z)\arrow[r,hook,"f^*"]&\Hom(X,Z).
		\end{tikzcd}\]
		Being a monomorphism in a category $\Cc$ means equivalently that it is an monomorphism in the opposite category $\Cc^{\op}$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{defn}
\section{elementary concepts}
\begin{defn}\leavevmode
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces and $f,g:X\to Y$ continuous maps. An \textbf{\textit{homotopy}} from $f$ to $g$ is a continuous map
		\[H:X\times[0,1]\to Y,\qquad(x,t)\mapsto H(x,t)=H_t(x)\])
		such that $f(x)=H(x,0)$ and $g(x)=H(x,1)$ for all $x\in X$. We denote this situation by $f\simeq g$. The homotopy relation $\simeq$ is an equivalence relation on the set of continuous maps $X\to Y$. A homotopy of maps $H_t:X\to Y$ is called \textbf{\textit{relative to $A\subset X$}} if $H_t|_A$ is constant.
		
		\item Topological spaces and homotopy classes of maps form a quotient category of $\Top$, the \textbf{\textit{homotopy category $\hTop$}}, where comoposition of homotopy classes is induced by composition of representing maps. If $f:X\to Y$ represents an isomorphism in $\hTop$, then $f$ is called a \textbf{\textit{homotopy equivalence}} or \textbf{\textit{$\operatorname{h}$-equivalence}}. In explicit termins this means $f:X\to Y$ is a homotopy equivalence if there exists $g:Y\to X$, a \textbf{\textit{homotopy inverse of $f$}}, such that $gf$ and $fg$ are both homotopic to the identity. Spaces $X$ and $Y$ are called \textbf{\textit{homotopy equivalent}} or of the same \textbf{\textit{homotopy type}} if there exists a homotopy equivalence $X\to Y$. A space is \textbf{\textit{contractible}} if it is homotopy equivalent to a point. A map $f:X\to Y$ is \textbf{\textit{null homotopic}} if it is homotopic to a constant map.
		
		\item Let $(X,x_0)$ be a pointed topological space and $s_0\in S^n$. The elements of the \textbf{\textit{$n$-th homotopy group}} are homotopy classes of maps $(S^n,s_0)\to (X,x_0)$. Equivalently, they are homotopy classes of maps $(I^n,\partial I^n)\to (X,x_0)$. (Homotopies are required to preserve the base points, $s_0\mapsto x_0$ or $\partial I^n\mapsto x_0$.)
		
		Also,
		\[\pi_n(X,*)=[(I^n,\partial I^n),(X,\{*\})]\cong[I^n/\partial I^n,X]^0\]
		where $[X,Y]$ denotes the set of homotopy classes $[f]$ of maps $[f]:X\to Y$.
		\begin{prop}
			$\pi_n(X,x_0)$ is an abelian group for all $n\in\N$.
		\end{prop}
				
		\item Let $A$ be a subspace of $X$ and $x_0\in A$. The elements of the \textbf{\textit{relative homotopy group $\pi_n(X,A,x_0)$}} are homotopy classes of maps $(I^n,\partial I^n,J^{n-1})\to (X,A,x_0)$ where $J^{n-1}$ is the union of all but one face of $I^n$. That is,
		\[\pi_{n+1}(X,A,*)=[(I^{n+1},\partial I^{n+1},J^n),(X,A,x_0)].\]
		
		The elements of such a group are homotopy classes of based maps $D^n\to X$ which carry the boundary $S^{n-1}$ into $A$. Two maps $f,g$ are called \textbf{\textit{homotopic relative to $A$}} if they are homotopic by a basepoint-preserving homotopy $F:D_n\times[0,1]\to X$ such that, for each $p$ in $S^{n-1}$ and $t$ in $[0,1]$, the element $F(p,t)$ is in $A$. Ordinary homotopy groups are recovered for the case in which $A=\{x_0\}$.
		\begin{remark}
			This construction is motivated by looking for the kernel of the induced map $i_*:\pi_n(A,x_0)\to\pi_n(X,x_0)$ by the inclusion. This map is in general not injective, and the kernel consists of ?
		\end{remark}
		\item For any pair $(X,A,x)$ we have a long exact sequence
		\[\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=small]
			\pi_n(A,x_0)\arrow[r,"i_*"]&\pi_{n}(X,x_0)\arrow[r,"j_*"]&\pi_{n-1}(X,A,x_0)\arrow[r,"\partial"]&\pi_{n-1}(A,x_0)\arrow[r]&\cdots\arrow[r]&\pi_0(X,x_0)
		\end{tikzcd}\]
		where $i$ and $j$ are the inclusions $(A,x_0)\hookrightarrow(X,x_0)$ and $(X,x_0,x_0)\hookrightarrow(X,A,x_0)$. The map $\partial$ comes from restricting maps $(I^n,\partial I^n,J^{n-1})\to (X,A,x_0)$ to $I^{n-1}$, or by restricting maps $(D^n,S^{n-1},s_0)\to (X,A,x_0)$. The map, called the \textbf{\textit{boundary map}}, is a homomorphism when $n>1$.
		
		\item A space $X$ with basepoint $x_0$ is called \textbf{\textit{$n$-connected}} if $\pi_i(X,x_0)=0$ for $i\leq n$. Thus 0-connected means path-connected and 1 connected means simply-connected.
		
		\item A pair $(X,A)$ is \textbf{\textit{$n$-connected}} if $\pi(X,A,x_0)=0$ for $i\leq n$.
		
		\item Two pointed spaces $(X,x_0)$ and $(Y,y_0)$ are \textbf{\textit{$n$-equivalent}} if $\pi_i(X,x_0)\cong\pi_i(Y,y_0)$ for all $i\leq n$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{defn}

\section{the right category}
\begin{itemize}
	\item We don't care so much about $\Top$. We care much more about $\CGWH$, the full subcategory of $\Top$ on \textbf{\textit{compactly generated wakly Hausdorff}} spaces.
	\item $X$ is \textbf{\textit{compactly generated}} if, for any subset $C\subset X$, and for all continuous maps $f:K\to X$ from compact Housdorff spaces, \[\text{if } f^{-1}(C) \text{is closed in }K\text{, then } C\text{ is closed}.\]
	\begin{claim}[What I picked up from the lecture]
		If $X$ is compactly generated, then $X$ is weakly Hausdorff if the diagonal subset $\Delta_X\subset X\times X$ is {\color{orange}$k$-closed}.
	\end{claim}
	From \cite{may}: The ordinary category of spaces allows pathology that obstructs a clean development of the foundations. The homotopy and homology groups of spaces are supported on compact subspaces, and it turns out that if one assumes a separation property that is a little weaker than the Hausdorff property, then one can refine the point-set topology of spaces to eliminate such pathology without changing these invariants.
	
	One major source of point-set level pathology can be passage to quotient spaces. Use of compactly generated topologies alleviates this.
	\begin{prop}
		If $X$ is compactly generated and $\pi:X\to Y$ is a quotient map, then $Y$ is compactly generated if and only if $(\pi\times \pi)^{-1}(\Delta Y)$ is closed in $X\times X$
	\end{prop}
	The interpretation is that a quotient space of a compactly generated space by a “closed equivalence relation” is compactly generated.
	
	{\color{cyan}Several other propositions follow in \cite{may}. Now some other notes from the lectures:}
	
	In $\CGWH$, $\Hom(X,Y)$ is a space with the compact-open topology. {\color{orange} This is a compactly generated space, $\mathbf{k}(\Hom(X,Y))$}. 
\begin{remark}

\section{cofibrations}
\begin{defn}\leavevmode
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A morphism $i$ has the \textbf{\textit{left lifting property with respect to a morphism $p$}} and $p$ has the \textbf{\textit{right lifting property with respect to $i$}} if for each morphisms $f$ and $g$, if the outer square in the following diagram commutes, there exists $\phi$ (I think not necessarily unique) completing the diagram:
\[\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large]
	A\arrow[r,"f"]\arrow[d,"i",swap]&X\arrow[d,"p"]\\
	B\arrow[r,"g",swap]\arrow[ur,dashed,"\phi"]&Y
\end{tikzcd}\]
		\item (\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cofibration}{wiki}) In mathematics, in particular in homotopy theory, a continuous map between topological spaces $i:A\to X$ is a \textbf{\textit{cofibration}} if it has the \textbf{\textit{homotopy extension property}} with respect to all topological spaces $S$.
		
		That is, $i$ is a cofibration if
		\begin{itemize}
			\item for each topological space $S$,
			\item and for any continuous maps $f,f':A\to S$
			\item and $g:X\to S$ with $g\circ i=f$,
			\item for any homotopy $h:A\times I\to S$ from $f$ to $f'$,
		\end{itemize}
		there is a continuous map $g':X\to S$ and a homotopy $h':X\times I\to S$ from $g$ to $g'$ such that
		\[h'(i(a),t)=h(a,t)\qquad\text{for all }a\in A\text{ and }t\in I.\]
		
		\item (\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_extension_property}{wiki}) Let $X$ be a topological space and let $A\subset X$. We say that the pair $(X,A)$ has the \textbf{\textit{homotopy extension property}} if, given a homotopy $f_\bullet:A\to Y^I$ and a map $\tilde{f}_0:X\to Y$ such that
		\[\tilde{f}_0\circ\iota=f_0\]
		{\color{cyan}(so $\tilde{f}$ is the lift of $f_0:A\to Y$)} then there exists an \textbf{\textit{extension}} of $f_\bullet$ to a homotopy $\tilde{f}_\bullet:X\to Y^I$ such that $\tilde{ƒ}_\bullet\circ\iota=f_\bullet$.
		
		That is,
		\[\begin{tikzcd}
			A\arrow[r,"f_\bullet"]\arrow[d,swap,"\iota"]&Y^I\arrow[d,"\pi_0"]\\
			X\arrow[ur,dashed,"\tilde{f}_\bullet"]\arrow[r,swap,"\tilde{f}_0"]&Y
		\end{tikzcd}\]
		{\color{persiangreen}So there's some \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying#Function_spaces}{currying} to make usual homotopies $f_\bullet:A\times I\to Y$ look like $f_\bullet:A\to Y^I$. Or, as said in our lectures, !a homotopy $X\times I\to Y$ is the same as a map $X\to \Map(I,Y)$".}
		
		\item (\cite{may}) A map $i:A\to X$ is a \textbf{\textit{cofibration}} if it satisfies the \textbf{\textit{homotopy extension property (HEP)}}. This means that if $h\circ i_0=f\circ i$ in the diagram
		\[\begin{tikzcd}
			A\arrow[rr,"i_0"]\arrow[dd,"i",swap]&&A\times I\arrow[dd,"i\times\id"]\arrow[dl,"h",swap]\\
			&Y\\
			X\arrow[ur,"f"]\arrow[rr,"i_0",swap]&&X\times I\arrow[ul,dashed,"\tilde{h}"]
		\end{tikzcd}\]
		then there exists $\tilde{h}$ that makes the diagram commute.
		
	\item In traditional topology, one usually means a Hurewicz cofibration. A map  $i:A\to X$ between topological spaces is a \textbf{\textit{Hurewicz cofibration}} if it satisfies the homotopy extension property.
	
	Let's say it one more time: for any $g:X\to Y$ and any homotopy $H:A\times I\to Y$ such that \[\begin{tikzcd}
		A\times\{0\}\arrow[r]\arrow[d]&A\times I\arrow[d]\\
		X\arrow[r,"g",swap]&Y
	\end{tikzcd}\]
	there is $H':X\times I\to Y$,
	\[\begin{tikzcd}
		X\times\{0\}\arrow[r]\arrow[d,"g"]&A\times I\arrow[d]\\
		X\times I\arrow[r,"H'",swap]&Y
	\end{tikzcd}\]
	such that
	\[\begin{tikzcd}
		A\times I\arrow[dr,"H"]\arrow[d]\\
		X\times I\arrow[r,"H'",swap]&Y
	\end{tikzcd}\]
\end{itemize}
\end{defn}
\begin{example}
$\partial D^n\to D$ is a Huerwicz cofibration. {\color{orange} Why?}
\end{example}
\begin{exercise}
	Prove that an inclusion $f : A \to X$ is a Hurewicz cofibration if and only if $A \times I \cup X \times \{0\}$ is a retract of $X \times I$.
\end{exercise}
\begin{defn}[Mapping cylinder]\leavevmode
	\begin{itemize}
		\item (\cite{may}) Although HEP is expressed in terms of general test diagrams, there is a certain universal test diagram {\color{cyan}(i.e. make the dashed map unique---up to something maybe)}. Namely, we can let $Y$ in our original test diagram be the \textbf{\textit{mapping cylinder}}
	\[Mi\equiv X\cup_i(A\times I)\]
	which is the pushout of $i$ and $i_0$. Indeed, suppose that we can construct a map $r$ that makes the following diagram commute
	\[\begin{tikzcd}
		A\arrow[rr,"i_0"]\arrow[dd,"i",swap]&&A\times I\arrow[dd,"i\times\id"]\arrow[dl]\\
		&Mi\\
		X\arrow[ur]\arrow[rr,"i_0",swap]&&X\times I\arrow[ul,dashed,"r"]
	\end{tikzcd}\]
	By the universal property of the pushouts, given maps $f$ and $h$ in our original test diagram induce a map $Mi\to Y$, and its comoposite with $r$ gives a homotopy $\tilde{h}$ that makes the diagram commute. {\color{cyan}So just saying that $Mi$ is universal.}
	\item (\href{https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/mapping+cylinder}{nLab}) Given a continuous map $f:X\to Y$ of topological spaces, one can define its \textbf{\textit{mapping cylinder}} as a pushout
	\[\begin{tikzcd}
		X\arrow[r,"f"]\arrow[d]&Y\arrow[d]\\
		X\times I\arrow[r,swap,"(\sigma_0)_*(f)"]&\Cyl(f)
	\end{tikzcd}\]
	in $\Top$, where $I=[0,1]$ and $\sigma:X\to X\times I$ is given by $x\mapsto(x,0)$.
	
	Set theoretically, the mapping cyllinder is usually represented as que quotient space
	\[\left(X\times I\coprod Y\right)\Big/\sim\]
	where $\sim$ is the smallest equivalence relation identifying $(x,0)\sim f(x)$ for all $x\in X$.
	
	\item (\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapping_cylinder}{wiki}) The \textbf{\textit{mapping cylinder}} of a function $f$ between topological spaces $X$ and $Y$ is the quotient
	\[M_f=(([0,1]\times X)\amalg Y)\big/\sim\]
	where $\amalg$ denotes disjoint union, and $\sim$ is the equivalence relation generated by
	\[(0,x)\sim f(x)\text{ for each }x\in X.\]
	{\color{red}That is, the mapping cylinder $M_f$ is obtained by gluing one end of $X\times[0,1]$ to $Y$ via the map $f$.} Notice that the ``top" of the cylinder $\{1\}\times X$ is homeomorphic to $X$, while the ``bottom" is the space $f(X)\subset Y$.
	
	\begin{quote}
		{\color{red}(Dani) So the mapping cylinder is just a deformation of $X$ to $f(X)$.}
	\end{quote}
	
	\item (Homework) Let $f:X\to Y$ be a map. Let $M_f=X\times[0,1]\cup_fY$ be the \textbf{\textit{mapping cylinder of $f$}}, i.e. the pushout of $X\overset{\cong}{\to}X\times\{0\}\hookrightarrow X\times[0,1]$ and of $f:X\times Y$.
	
	
	\end{itemize}
\end{defn}
\begin{exercise}
	Let $g:X\to M_f$ be the map $X\overset{\cong}{\to}X\times\{1\}\to M_f$. Let $h:M_f\to Y$ be the map that is induced by $X\times[0,1]\to Y:(x,t)\mapsto f(x)$ and $\id_Y:Y\to Y$. Observe that $f$ is the composition of $g$ and $h$.
	\[\begin{tikzcd}
		X\arrow[r,"f"]\arrow[d,swap,"\id\times 1"]\arrow[rd,bend right,"g"]&Y\arrow[d]\arrow[ddr,bend left,"\id_Y"]\\
		X\times[0,1]\arrow[r,swap]\arrow[drr,bend right,swap,"(x\text{,}t)\mapsto f(x)"]&M_f\arrow[ul, phantom, "\ulcorner", very near start]\arrow[dr,dashed,"h"]\\
		&&Y
	\end{tikzcd}\]
	
	In both exercises below you might have to use the fact that pushouts are colimits and that colimits commute with products in $\CGWH$, i.e. $(\colim A_i)\times B$ is canonically homeomorphic with $\colim(A_i \times B)$.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Show that $h$ is a deformation retract, and in particular is a homotopy equivalence.
		\item Show that $g : X \to M_f$ is a cofibration. You may use exercise (a), but the direct proof might be simpler.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}[Solution]\leavevmode
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item That $h$ is a deformation retract is consequence of the last diagram. {\color{orange}Why is it a homotopy equivalence?}
		\item Consider the following lifting problem:
		\[\begin{tikzcd}
			X\arrow[d,"g",swap]\arrow[r,"H"]&Y^I\arrow[d,"\pi_0"]\\
			M_f\arrow[ur,dashed]\arrow[r,"h",swap]&Y
		\end{tikzcd}\]
		{\color{orange}Looks nice but why should the dashed arrow exist…?}

	A \textbf{\textit{weak factorization system $(\Lc,\Rc)$}} on a category $\Mc$ is comprised o two clases of morphisms $\Lc$ and $\Rc$ so that

\begin{exercise}[3.1.8 from \cite{riehl}]
Verify that the class of morphisms $\Lc$ characterized by the left lifting property against a fixed class of morphisms $\Rc$ is closed under coproducts, closed under retracts, and contains the isomorphisms.
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}[Solution]
\textbf{\textit{(Coproducts.)}} {\color{magenta} Sergey: Coproduct of morphisms $A_i\to B_i$ in a category $\Cc$ is the obvious morphism $\sqcup A_i \to \sqcup B_i$. (Because in this construction morphisms $A_i\to B_i$ are seen as objects of what's called the arrow category of the category $\Cc$)}

Suppose the maps $\ell_i:A_i\to B_i$ are in $\Lc$. Then their coproduct in the arrow category is the obvious map $\coprod A_i\to\coprod B_i$.

Explicitly, their coproduct is an arrow $\coprod\ell_i$ and a collection of maps $f_i:\ell_i\to\coprod\ell_i$ such that for any other object $m:A\to B$ in the arrow category and a map $g:\ell\to m$, the following diagram is completed uniquely:
\[\begin{tikzcd}[scale cd=1.2]
	\ell_i\arrow[r,"f_i"]\arrow[rr,bend right,"g",swap]&\coprod\ell_i\arrow[r,dashed,"\exists!"]&m
\end{tikzcd}\qquad\forall i\]
So we conclude that the source of $\coprod\ell_i$ is $\coprod A_i$ and its target $\coprod B_i$. Indeed, we really looking at
\[\begin{tikzcd}[scale cd=1.2]
	A_i\arrow[r,"\ell_i"]\arrow[d,"f_i^1",swap]&B_i\arrow[d,"f_i^2"]\\
	\coprod A_i\arrow[r,"\coprod\ell_i"]\arrow[d,"\exists!",dashed,swap]&\coprod B_i\arrow[d,dashed,"\exists!"]\\
	A\arrow[r,swap,"m"]&B
\end{tikzcd}\]

Now consider the following lifting problem with respect to a morphism $r\in\Rc$:
\[\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large]
	\coprod A_i\arrow[d,swap,"\coprod\ell_i"]\arrow[r]&\bullet\arrow[d,"r\in\Rc"]\\
	\coprod B_i\arrow[r]&\bullet
\end{tikzcd}\]
Since $\ell_i\in\Lc$, we have maps
\[\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large]
	A_i\arrow[r]\arrow[d,"\Lc\ni\ell_i",swap]&\coprod A_i\arrow[d]\arrow[r]&\bullet\arrow[d,"r\in\Rc"]\\
	B_i\arrow[r]\arrow[rru,dashed]&\coprod B_i\arrow[r]&\bullet
\end{tikzcd}\]
which in turn means we have unique maps
\[\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large]
	A_i\arrow[r]\arrow[d,"\Lc\ni\ell_i",swap]&\coprod A_i\arrow[d]\arrow[r]&\bullet\arrow[d,"r\in\Rc"]\\
	B_i\arrow[r]\arrow[rru]&\coprod B_i\arrow[r]\arrow[ur,dashed]&\bullet
\end{tikzcd}\]
by the universal property of the coproduct $\coprod B_i$.

So, to check that the lower-right triangle commutes, it would be sufficient to show that the map $B_i\to\coprod B_i$ "can be cancelled" since
\[\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large]
	A_i\arrow[r]\arrow[d,"\Lc\ni\ell_i",swap]&\coprod A_i\arrow[d]\arrow[r]&{\color{red}\bullet}\arrow[d,"r\in\Rc",red]\\
	{\color{red}B_i}\arrow[r,red]\arrow[rru]&{\color{red}\coprod B_i}\arrow[r]\arrow[ur,dashed,red]&{\color{red}\bullet}
\end{tikzcd}\quad
\begin{array}{c}
	\text{is already}\\
	\text{the same as}
\end{array}\quad
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large]
A_i\arrow[r]\arrow[d,"\Lc\ni\ell_i",swap]&\coprod A_i\arrow[d]\arrow[r]&\bullet\arrow[d,"r\in\Rc"]\\
{\color{red}B_i}\arrow[r,red]\arrow[rru]&{\color{red}\coprod B_i}\arrow[r,red]\arrow[ur,dashed]&{\color{red}\bullet}
\end{tikzcd}\]
Likeways, to make sure that the remaining triangle commutes we observe that
\[\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large]
	{\color{red}A_i}\arrow[r,red]\arrow[d,"\Lc\ni\ell_i",swap]&{\color{red}\coprod A_i}\arrow[d,red]\arrow[r]&{\color{red}\bullet}\arrow[d,"r\in\Rc"]\\
	B_i\arrow[r]\arrow[rru]&{\color{red}\coprod B_i}\arrow[r]\arrow[ur,dashed,red]&\bullet
\end{tikzcd}\quad
\begin{array}{c}
	\text{is already}\\
	\text{the same as}
\end{array}
\quad
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large]
	{\color{red}A_i}\arrow[r,red]\arrow[d,"\Lc\ni\ell_i",swap]&{\color{red}\coprod A_i}\arrow[d]\arrow[r,red]&{\color{red}\bullet}\arrow[d,"r\in\Rc"]\\
	B_i\arrow[r]\arrow[rru]&\coprod B_i\arrow[r]\arrow[ur,dashed]&\bullet
\end{tikzcd}\]
{\color{magenta}Why can we "cancel" the maps $A_i\to\coprod A_i$ and $B_i\to\coprod B_i$?}

\section{whitehead theorem}

We introduce a large class of spaces, called CW complexes, between which a weak equivalence is necessarily a homotopy equivalence. Thus, for such spaces, the homotopy groups are, in a sense, a complete set of invariants. Moreover, we shall see that every space is weakly equivalent to a CW complex.
\begin{defn}[\cite{may}]\label{defn:CW-complex}\leavevmode
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item A \textbf{\textit{CW complex}} $X$ is a space $X$ which is the union of an expanding sequence of subspaces $X^n$ such that, inductively, $X^0$ is a discrete set of points (called \textbf{\textit{vertices}}) and $X^{n+1}$ is the pushout obtained from $X^n$ by attaching disks $D^{n+1}$ along \textbf{\textit{attaching maps}} $j:S^n\to X^n$. {\color{cyan}Thus $X^{n+1}$ is the quotient space obtained from $X^n\cup(J_{n+1}\times D^{n+1})$ by identifying $(j,x)$ with $j(x)$ for $x\in S^n$, where $J_{n+1}$ is the discrete set of such attaching maps $j$ (see \cref{adjuntion-space})}. Each resulting map $D^{n+1}\to X$ is called a \textbf{\textit{cell}}. The subspace $X^n$ is called the \textbf{\textit{$n$-skeleton}} of $X$.
			\[\begin{tikzcd}
			S^n\arrow[r,"i",hook]\arrow[d,swap,"j"]&D^{n+1}\arrow[d,]\\
			X^n\arrow[r]&X^{n+1}\arrow[ul, phantom, "\ulcorner", very near start]
		\end{tikzcd}\]
	\end{enumerate}
\end{defn}
\begin{lemma}[HELP]
	content...
\end{lemma}
\begin{thm}[Whitehead, \cite{may}]
	If $X$ is a CW complex and $e:Y\to Z$ is an $n$-equivalence, then $e_*:[X,Y]\to[X,Z]$ is a bijection if $\dim X<n$ and surjection if $\dim X=n$.
\end{thm}
\begin{thm}[Whitehead, \cite{may}]\label{thm:W2}
	An $n$-equivalence between CW complexes of dimension less than $n$ is a homotopy equivalence. A weak equivalence between CW complexes is a homotopy equivalence.
\end{thm}
\begin{thm}[Whitehead (4.5), \cite{hatcher-at}]
	If a map $f:X\to Y$ between connected CW complexes induces isomorphisms $f_*:\pi_n(X)\to\pi_n(Y)$ for all $n$, then $f$ is a homotopy equivalence. In case $f$ is the inclusion of a subcomplex $X\hookrightarrow Y$, the conlusion is stronger: $X$ is a deformation retract of $Y$.
\end{thm}
\begin{exercise}[Hatcher 4.1.12]
	Show that an $n$-connected, $n$-dimensional CW complex is contractible.
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}[Solution]
	Just recall that $n$-connectedness means that $\pi_i(X)=0$ for all $i\leq n$, which means that $X$ is contractible by \cref{thm:W2}.

%	A map $p:E\to B$ has the \textbf{\textit{homotopy lifting property (HLP)}} for the space $X$ if the following holds: for each homotopy $h:W\times I\to B$ and each map $a:X\to E$
%\end{defn}
\begin{lemma}[Yoneda]	
	\[\left\{\text{Natural transformations }\Hom(-,X)\to F\right\}\cong F(X)\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{coro}
	$(\Hom(-,X)\to\Hom(-,Y))\cong\Hom(X,Y)$.
\end{coro}
\begin{coro}
	The correspondence $X\mapsto\Hom(-,X)$ is fully faithful, that is, the correspondence $\Hom(X,X')\to\Hom(\Hom(-,X),\Hom(-,X'))$ is injective and bijective. (The right hand side are natural transformations of functors.)
\end{coro}
\begin{proof}[Solution of exercise 1] The latter correspondence sends isomorphisms to isomorphisms. Since we are given a natural isomorphism in the problem, we conclude $X\cong X'$.

\begin{proof}
	Let $g:B\to X$ be the homotopy inverse of $f$.
	
	\textbf{(Step 1)} Construct another pullback
	\[\begin{tikzcd}
		E\times_BB\arrow[r]\arrow[d,two heads]&X\times_BE\arrow[r]\arrow[d,two heads]&E\arrow[d,two heads]\\
		B\arrow[r,"g",swap]&X\arrow[r,"f",swap]&B
	\end{tikzcd}\]
	
	\textbf{(Step 2)} Constuct $E\to E\times_BB$.
	
	Consider

		E\arrow[rr,"\id"]\arrow[d]&&E\arrow[d,two heads]\\
		E\times I\arrow[r,"f\times \id",swap]\arrow[rru,dashed]&B\times I\arrow[r]&B?
	\end{tikzcd}\]
	And then $E\to E\times_BB\to E\times_BX\to E$ is homotopic to the identity.
	
	Constructing the other homotopic inverse is the hard part.

\end{proof}
\begin{coro}
	$B\overset{f}{\to}B$ is homotopy equivalence and $E\to B$ is a fibration, in

	$E\times_BB\to E$ is a homotopy equivalence.

\subsection{Serre fibration long exact sequence (21 march)}

We've been talking a lot about Hurewickz fibrations. Let's talk about Serre fibrations. Notice that H. fibration $\implies$ S. fibration. What is the most natural example of a Serre fibration?

\begin{prop}
	Let $E$ be a fiber bundle with fiber $F$. Then $f$ is a Serre fibration.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	What sdoes it mean to be a Serre fibration? It means that
	\[\begin{tikzcd}
		I^n\arrow[r]\arrow[d]&E\arrow[d]\\
		I^{n+1}=I^n\times I\arrow[r]\arrow[ur,dashed]&B
	\end{tikzcd}\]
	So if $\Uc$ is a covering of $B$ such that $f^{-1}U\cong U\times F$. By Lebesgue lemma, there is a $\delta>0$ such that for all $x\in I^{n+1}$, the ball $B(x,\delta)$ lies in some $f^{-1}U$ for some $U$.
	
	Then we subdivide $I^{n+1}$ in smaller cubes of the same size with diameter $<\delta$. So, each the image of each cube lies in some $U\in\Uc$.
	
	Then
	\[\begin{tikzcd}
		I^n\arrow[d]\arrow[r]&F\times U\arrow[d,two heads]\\
		I^{n+1}\arrow[r]\arrow[ur,dashed]&U
	\end{tikzcd}\]
	has a lift for every little square because
	\[\begin{tikzcd}
		X\arrow[r]\arrow[d]&U\arrow[d]\\
		X\times I\arrow[r]\arrow[ur,dashed]&pt
	\end{tikzcd}\]
	is always a fibration {\color{orange}(think about this)} and because pullbacks of fibrations are fibrations:
	\[\begin{tikzcd}
		U\times F\arrow[r,two heads]\arrow[d,two heads]&U\arrow[d,two heads]&\\
		F\arrow[r,two heads]&pt
	\end{tikzcd}\].
	Then we may just add up the squares because
	\[\begin{tikzcd}
		D^n\arrow[d]\\
		D^n\times I
	\end{tikzcd}\]
	and we're done.
\end{proof}
\begin{prop}[Construction of homotopy long exact sequence from relative homotopy long exact sequence]
	Let $g:E\to B$ is a Serre fibration. $e\in E$, $g(e)= b$ and $g^{-1}=F$. Then consider the exact sequence in homotopy of the Serre fibration and the relative homotopy exact sequence. Then there is a long exact sequence (top row):
	\[\begin{tikzcd}
		\cdots\arrow[r]&\pi_n(F)\arrow[r]&\pi_n(E)\arrow[r]&\pi_n(B)\arrow[r]&\pi_{n-1}(F)\arrow[r]&\pi_{n-1}(E)\arrow[r]&\cdots\\
		\cdots\arrow[r]&\pi_n(F)\arrow[r]\arrow[u,"="]&\pi_n(E)\arrow[r]\arrow[u,"="]&\pi_n(E,F)\arrow[r]\arrow[u,"\cong",dashed]&\pi_{n-1}(F)\arrow[r]\arrow[u,"="]&\pi_{n-1}(E)\arrow[r]\arrow[u,"="]&\cdots
	\end{tikzcd}\]
\end{prop}
\begin{example}
	We have shown that $\pi_2(\C P^n)\cong\Z$ using the Hopf fibration $S^1\hookrightarrow S^{2n+1}\to\C P^n$ and the fact that $\pi_k(S^n)=0$ for $k<n$.
\end{example}
\begin{thm}
	Let $X$ be a CW-comples, $A,B\subset X$ subcomplexes, $C=A\cap B\neq\varnothing$, so
	\[\begin{tikzcd}
		C\arrow[r]\arrow[d]&A\arrow[d]\\
		B\arrow[r]&X \arrow[ul, phantom, "\ulcorner", very near start]
	\end{tikzcd}\]
	is a pushout (this happens for inclusions, {\color{orange} check it?}).
	
	If $(A,C)$ is $n$-connected and $(B,C)$ is $m$-connected, then
	\[\pi_i(A,C)\to\pi_i(X,B)\]
	is an isomorphism for $i<m+n$ and sujerctive for $i=m+n$.
\end{thm}

\subsection{blakers-massey (26 march)}
First I show some basic constructions from Tom Dieck (sec. 5.7). Let $f:X\to Y$ be a map. Consider the pullback
\[\begin{tikzcd}
	W(f)\arrow[r]\arrow[d,"(q\text{,}p)",swap]&Y^I\arrow[d,"(\ev_0\text{,}\ev_1)"]\\
	X\times Y\arrow[r,"f\times\id",swap]&Y\times Y
\end{tikzcd}\]
where
\begin{gather*}
	W(f)=\{(x,w)\in X\times Y^I|f(x)=w(0)\},\\
	q(x,w)=x,\quad p(x,w)=w(1).
\end{gather*}
Since $(\ev_0,\ev_1)$ is a fibration, the maps $(q,p)$, $q$ and $p$ are fibrations.

Now suppose $f$ is a pointed map with base points $*$. Then $W(f)\to W'$ is given the base point $(*,k_*)$.

Let $f:A\hookrightarrow X$ be an inclusion.

\begin{defn}
	By $(I^n,\partial I^n)\to (*\times_{\ev_0}X^I\times_{\ev_1}A,\pt)$ is the same as a map $I^n\times I\to X$ that satisfies:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $I^n\{0\}\cup\partial I^n\times I\to*$.
		\item $I^n\times\{1\}\to A$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{defn}
It is fairly straightforward to show that
\[\begin{tikzcd}
	\cdots\arrow[r]&\Omega A\arrow[r]&\Omega X\arrow[r]&\hofib\arrow[r]&A\arrow[r]&X
\end{tikzcd}\]
\[\begin{tikzcd}
	\pi_0(\nearrow)=&\pi_n(A)\arrow[r]&\pi_n(X)\arrow[r]\arrow[dr]&\pi_{n-1}(\hofib)\arrow[d,"\cong"]\arrow[r]&\pi_{n-1}(A)\arrow[r]&\pi_{n-1}(X)\\
	&&&\pi_n(X,A)\arrow[ur]
\end{tikzcd}\]
\begin{thm}[Blakers-Massey 1]
	Let 
	\[\begin{tikzcd}
		Q\arrow[r,"g"]\arrow[d,swap,"f"]&Y\arrow[d]\\
		X\arrow[r]&P
	\end{tikzcd}\]
	be a homotopy pushout, $g$ is $m$ equivalence, $f$ is $n$-equivalence and $m,n\geq0$. Then $Q\to X\times_P^h$ is $(m+n-1)$-equivalence.
\end{thm}
\begin{thm}[Blakers-Massey 2]
	$P$ is a CW-complex, $X$, $Y$ subcomplexes, $X\cap Y=Q\neq\varnothing$ (\textbf{\textit{strict pushout}})
	\[\begin{tikzcd}
		Q\arrow[r,tail]\arrow[d,tail]&Y\arrow[d,tail]\\
		X\arrow[r,tail]&X\arrow[ul, phantom, "\lrcorner", very near start]
	\end{tikzcd}\]
	Then $\pi_i(Y,\Q)\to\pi_i(P,X)$ is epi for $i=m+n$ and iso for $0\leq i<m+n$.
\end{thm}
\begin{thm}[Blakers-Massey 3]
	$P=X\cup Y$, $X$ and $Y$ are open in $P$, $X\cap Y=Q\neq\varnothing$.
\end{thm}
We proved the third version based on Tom Dieck's proof.
\begin{defn}\leavevmode
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 	A map is a \textbf{\textit{$k$-equivalence}} if the induced map on the $i$th homotopy group is an isomorphism for $i<k$ and an epimorphism for $i=k$.
		\item $K_p(W):=\{x\in W:\text{ at least $p$ coordinates of $x$ are < the same coordinates of the center of }W\}$
	\end{itemize}
\end{defn}
\begin{lemma}
	Let $W$ be a cube in $\R^d$ with $\dim W\leq d$. If for all faces $W'$ of $\partial W$, $f(W')\in A\implies w'\in K_p(W')$, then there is a homotopy $f\simeq g\;\rel\partial W$ such that $g(w)\in A\implies w\in K_p(W)$.
\end{lemma}

\subsection{freudenthal theorem (2 april)}
\begin{defn}
	The appropriate analogue of the Cartesian product in the category of based spaces is the \textbf{\textit{smash product}} $X\wedge Y$ defined by
	\[X\wedge Y=X\times Y/X\vee Y.\]
	Here $X\vee Y$ is viewed as the subspace of $X\times Y$ consisting of those pairs $(x,y)$ such that either $x$ is the basepoint of $X$ or $y$ is the basepoint of $Y$.
\end{defn}
We also have the \textbf{\textit{suspension of pointed spaces}}, which is like usual suspension but also collapsing the distinguished point, which has become an interval:
\[\Sigma X=(I\times X)/(t,x)\sim (0,y)\sim (1,y)\;\forall y\in X.\]


Then we have
\[\Hom_{\CGWH_*}(\Sigma X,\Sigma X)\cong\Hom_{\CGWH_*}(X,\Omega\Sigma X)\]
where $\Sigma X=S^\wedge X$ and $\Omega\Sigma X=\Map(S^1,\Sigma X)$. That is, $S^1\wedge-$ is adjoint to $\Map(S^1,-)$.

So let $X$ be a space. The identity map $\id_{\Sigma X}:\Sigma X\to \Sigma X$ then induces a map $X\to\Omega\Sigma X$.
\begin{thm}[Freudenthal]\label{thm:freudenthal}
	Let $X$ be $\ell$-connected space. Then $X\to\Omega\Sigma X$ is a $(2\ell+1)$-equivalence, that is,
	\[\pi_i(X)\to \pi_{i+1}(\Sigma X),\]
	$(\ell+1)+(\ell+1)-1=2\ell+1$.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}[Proof 1]
	Using pushouts…
%	\[\begin{tikzcd}
%		X\arrow[r,"(\ell+1)\text{-equivalence}"]&*\arrow[rdd,bend left]\\
%		
%	\end{tikzcd}\]
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof 2]
	Consider
	\[\begin{tikzcd}
		X\arrow[r]\arrow[d]&CX\arrow[d]\\
		CX\arrow[r]&\Sigma X
	\end{tikzcd}\]
	Then we use relative homotopy long exact sequence with $(X,CX)$ to get $\pi_i(CX,X)\cong\pi_{i-i}(X)$, which is zero for $0\leq i\leq \ell+1$. Then use relative homotopy exact sequence for the pair $(\Sigma X,CX)$. then we get that $\pi_i(\Sigma X,CX)=\pi_i(\Sigma X)$. And then if you use it for $(\Sigma X, X)$ and 
	
	But it also turns out that $\pi_i(\Sigma X)=\pi_{i-1}(\Omega\Sigma X)$ because
	\begin{align*}
		\pi_n(Z)&=\Hom_{\hTop,*}(S^n,Z)=\Hom(S^1\wedge S^{n-1},Z)=\Hom(S^{n-1},\Omega Z)=\pi_{n-1}(\Omega,Z)
	\end{align*}.
	And then since $CX\hookrightarrow \Sigma X$ we get an arrow $\pi_i(CX,X)\to\pi_i(\Sigma X,CX)$ which is isomorphism for $0\leq i \leq 2\ell +1$ and surjective for $i=2\ell+2$.
	
	So apply Blakers-Massey an ell equalities to get maps fro $\pi_{i-1}(X)\to\pi_{i-1}(\Omega\Sigma X)$ for $i$ as desired.
\end{proof}
\begin{coro}
	If $X$ is $\ell$-connected, then $\Sigma X$ is $(\ell+1)$-connected for $\ell\geq0$.
\end{coro}
\[\begin{matrix}
	S^0&\Sigma S^0=S^1&\Sigma^2S^0=S^2&\Sigma^3S^0=S^3&\cdots&\Sigma^nS^0=S^n\\
	-1&0&1&2&\cdots&(n-1)
\end{matrix}\]
\begin{coro}
	$S^n$ is $(n-1)$-connected.
\end{coro}
Back to Hopf fibration:
\[S^1\hookrightarrow S^3\to S^2\]
we get
\[0=\pi_2(S^3)\to\pi_2(S^2)\overset{\cong}{\to}\pi_1(S^1)\to\pi_1(S^3)=0,\]
so
\[\Z=\pi_2(S^2).\]
Now consider a map $S^n\to S^n$. We get a map $CS^n\to CS^n$ (in general, for $f:X\to Y$ we have $(t,x)\mapsto(t,f(x))$ in the cones). We also have $CS^n\to CS^n/S^n=S^{n+1}$.

Now if we take $\id:S^n\to S^n$ we shall get $\id:S^{n+1}\to S^{n+1}$. Think about this like $\pi_1(S^1)\to\pi_2(S^2)$. Now from Freudenthal we get $\pi_{i-1}(X)\to\pi_i(\Sigma X)$ is surjective because $i=0$. From Hopf fibration we have $\pi_2(S^2)=\Z$. So we have a surjective map $\Z\to\Z$. So it's an isomorphism and we conclude that $\id_{S^2}$ is a generator of $\pi_2(S^2)$.

\begin{coro}
	Since $S^n$ is $(n-1)$-connected, we have
	\[\pi_i(S^n)\to\pi_{i+1}(S^{n+1})\]
	is isomorphism for $i\leq 2(n-1)=2n-1$ and epimorphism form $i=2n-1$. (We just shift the indices of \cref{thm:freudenthal} by one.)
\end{coro}
\begin{coro}
	$\pi_n(S^n)=\Z$ with $\id_{S^n}$ as generator.
\end{coro}
\begin{coro}
	$\pi_{n+k}(S^n)\to\pi_{n+k+1}(S^{n+1})$ is isomorphism for $k\leq n-1$ and epimorphism for $k=n-1$.
\end{coro}
So for example
\[\pi_4(S^3)=\pi_5(S^4)=\pi_6(S^5).\]
And in fact they are $\Z/2$. This is what are called the \textbf{\textit{$k$th stable homotopy groups of a sphere}}. And more in general, we take any space and apply $\Omega\Sigma$ enough times, and the homotopy will start to stabilize.

Or for example from
\[S^1\hookrightarrow S^3\to S^2\]
we get
\[0=\pi_i(S^1)\to \pi_i(S^3)\overset{\cong}{\to}\pi_i(S^2)\to\pi_{i-1}(S^2)=0\]
So $\pi_3(S^2)\cong\Z$ in case you were wondering.
\begin{claim}[Serre]
	$\pi_{4n-1}(S^{2n})\cong\Z\oplus$finite abelian. And $\pi_i(S^k)$ is finite abelian in all other cases.
\end{claim}

\subsection{another application of Blakers-Massey (2 april)}
Glue a disk to a space and what happens to homotopy groups?
\[\begin{tikzcd}
	S^{n-1}\arrow[r,"(n-1)\text{-equiv}"]\arrow[d,"0\text{-equiv}",swap]&D^n\arrow[d]\\
	X\arrow[r]&X\cup D^n
\end{tikzcd}\]
Assume $X$ is connected. We get a map from the vertical arrows
\[\begin{tikzcd}
	\pi_i(D^n,S^{n-1})\arrow[r]&\pi_i(X\cup D^n,X)
\end{tikzcd}\]
which is $(n-1)$-equivalence since $S^{n-1}\to D^n$ is an $(n-1)$-equivalence, which is the case since
\[\begin{tikzcd}
	0=\pi_i(D^n)\arrow[r]&\pi_i(D^n,S^{n-1})\arrow[r,"\cong"]&\pi_{i-1}(S^{n-1})\arrow[r]&\pi_{i-1}(D^n)=0
\end{tikzcd}\]
so $\pi_i(D^n,S^{n-1})=0$ for $i\leq n-1$.
